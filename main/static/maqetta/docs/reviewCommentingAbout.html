<h1>About Review and Commenting</h1>

<p>Maqetta includes a web-based review and commenting features that allows
authors to share their HTML pages with their team members and receive feedback comments.
</p>

<h2>Initiating a review session</h2>

<p>To initiate a team review, select the "New Review" command found on the "New" menu at the top of the product:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_new_review_command.png"></img></p>

<p>This will bring up the New Review wizard, which has 3 sections. 
The first section is for general information about this review session, such
as title and description. You can also define an end date for the review
and customize the window size that will be used when the HTML pages are presented to the user.</p>
<p><img src="img/review_new_wizard_1.png"></img></p>

<p>The second section of the wizard is where you choose which files from your workspace
should be included in the review. You can either select a file and click the right-arrow icon
or double-click on files to move them into the right section, which shows the files you have selected.</p>
<p><img src="img/review_new_wizard_2.png"></img></p>

<p>The third section of the wizard is where you choose the list of reviewers. 
You can enter email addresses manually. (Note: If your particular installation of
Maqetta is integrated with a user database (e.g., LDAP), then you might be able
to start typing partial names or email addresses, with auto-complete to show you
users that match what you have typed so far.)</p>
<p><img src="img/review_new_wizard_3.png"></img></p>

<p>Once you have selected files and reviewers, click on the <strong>Publish</strong> button to initiate
the review session.</p>

<p>The Publish button will cause an email invitation to be sent to each reviewer:</p>
<div class="note" style="width:100%;">
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Subject:</td><td>You have been invited to review published file(s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>To:</td><td>&lt;your name and email&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>From:</td><td>(no reply)</td></tr>
</table>
<div>
<br/>
sue@example.com has invited you to review this page.<br/>
sue@example.com's message: Proposed admin panel for the new data manager application.<br/>
<br/>
You can review the page by clicking this link: http://&lt;hostname&gt;/maqetta/review/sue@example.com
<br/>
</div>
</div>

<p>The email contains the URL which will launch Maqetta in review mode. Upon clicking on this
link, reviewers should see Maqetta's review mode launch in a new browser window:</p>

<p><img src="img/review_board_1.png" style="width:100%;"></img></p>

<p>The Reviews palette shows the list of review sessions that this user has been invited.
The picture above shows one review session, "Admin panel". To see the files that are included
in the Admin panel review session, open up "Admin panel" to see its child contents
(in this case, Sample1.html.rev and Sample2.html.rev):</p>

<p><img src="img/review_board_2.png"></img></p>

<p>The reviewer can now double-click on one of the files (e.g., Sample1.html) to view
the page and comment on it:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_3.png" style="width:100%;"></img></p>

<p>The reviewer can add a plain-text comment in the Comments palette by clicking on the "Add Comment" icon:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_add_comment_icon.png"></img></p>

<p>which will cause a comment entry form to appear at the top of the Comments palette into which
the reviewer can provide plain text feedback:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_comments_1.png"></img></p>

<p>While creating a new comment or editing an existing comment (i.e., while the comment entry form is open for editing),
the reviewer can also use the annotation icons to draw rectangles, ovals, arrows and plain text on top of the HTML page he is viewing:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_annotation_icons.png"></img></p>

<p>For example, the reviewer might put an oval around the tabs in the tab palette:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_annotation_1.png" style="width:100%;"></img></p>

<p>Upon hitting Submit in the Comments palette for the new comment he has created, 
his comment (and associated annotations) will be added to the review and the add comment form will close:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_comments_2.png"></img></p>

<p>Other reviewers can click on "Reply" to add a sub-comment to existing comments or click on the "Add Comment"
icon to add new comments.</p>

<p>Many UI mockups will consist of multiple application states, where
different parts of the application are visible in one state and other parts of the
application are visible in a different state. A review can switch between
states and add comments about that particular state by alternately clicking
through the states listed in the States palette.</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_states_palette_1.png"></img></p>
<p>For example, in the picture below,
the review has turned on the "Add Task" state, causing the "Add Task" dialog to appear on the main canvas:</p>
<p><img src="img/review_board_states_palette_2.png" style="width:100%;"></img></p>
