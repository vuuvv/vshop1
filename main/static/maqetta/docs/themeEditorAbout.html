<h1>About the Theme Editor</h1>

<p>A &quot;theme&quot; is a collection of CSS files that provide a
consistent set of visual styling rules that work across a widget library (i.e.,
Dojo). A theme typically defines the following characteristics across a variety
of widgets:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: 0pt;" type="disc">
 <li>Border styling (thickness, color, rounding of box corners)</li>
 <li>Background styling (color, background images, background repeats)</li>
 <li>Text styling</li>
 <li>Margins and padding</li>
 <li>Icons used by the widgets (arrows, &quot;x&quot; close icons, +/- icons for trees)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Dojo toolkit ships with a handful of standard themes
(tundra, soria, nihilo, noir), and with Dojo 1.5, there is a new theme,
<b>Claro</b>.</p>

<p>Maqetta ships with <b>Claro</b> as the default theme, which can be customized using the Claro theme editor.
With the theme editor, you can customize the default styling for various
widgets. For example, you might want buttons to have a dark blue border with 
light brown background.</p>

<h2>Launching the Theme Editor</h2>

<p>To launch the theme editor, select <b>Open > Theme Editor</b> from the Maqetta menu bar. 
Your browser window should look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="img/Maqetta_ThemeEditor.png" target="_blank"><img alt="image" src="img/Maqetta_ThemeEditor.png" style="margin: 1em 1em 0pt 0pt;" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>All of the supported widgets are displayed on the theme editor canvas. The widgets are divided into
three sections: <b>Global Styling</b>, <b>Primitive Widgets</b> and <b>Container Widgets</b>.
Click on any widget to select it. When a widget is selected, its properties can be customized in the Properties palette.</p>

<h2>Global Styling</h2>

<p>The Global Styling section is for setting styles that apply globally.  There are two types of elements that can be set globally: text and widgets.</p>

<p>The <b>Generic text</b> block is for setting text styles that apply to all widgets that contain text elements. To see what widgets are affected, select the generic text block and experiment with setting various text styles in the <b>Text and Font</b> section of the Properties palette.  HTML elements that contain text (such as &lt;label&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h3&gt; and &lt;a&gt;) are also affected by the styles set on the generic text block.</p>

<p>The <b>Global Background and Border</b> widget represents a generic widget and allows you to globally set the background and border for all widgets. These properties are under the <b>Background</b> and <b>Border</b> sections of the Properties palette.</p>

<p class="note">Note: Changes made with the <b>Global Background and Border</b> widget will override changes previously made to individual widgets. If you want to customize individual widgets for your theme, you should make all global changes first, then make the individual widget changes.</p>


<h2>Customizing the look of a particular type of widget</h2>

<p>To customize the visual styling for a particular type of widget, select the widget on the theme editor canvas and modify the styling properties for that widget in the Properties palette. </p>

<!--<p>The styling assigned to certain widgets will have an indirect effect on other widgets that contain the widget being styled.</p>-->

<p>Some complex widgets, such as Calendar, allow different styling for different &quot;subwidgets&quot;, which are particular sub-elements to the given widget. 
When you select a complex widget, a panel opens with a selectable list of the subwidgets contained in the widget.  By default the outer container widget is selected.  If you select one of the subwidgets, that subwidget is outlined in red on the widget.  Any changes made in the Properties palette will affect only the component that is selected.</p>

<p>For Calendar, you can customize the styling on several things, including the year, the month, the days of the week (Sun to Sat), and the dates (0 to 31).</p>

<h2>Widget States</h2>

<p>The term &quot;widget states&quot; refers to the various interactive
states that a widget might have. For example, the Dojo Button widget has three
widget states: Normal, Hover and
Disabled. When the mouse hovers over a button or a button is inactive/disabled,
Dojo changes certain CSS properties, such as border color, font color, and
background properties, in order to provide visual feedback at runtime.</p>

<p>In the theme editor you can style each widget state using the States palette, which contains a list of all the states.  
You click on a state in the State palette to make that state the current state.  As you click on each state, you will notice that the widget styles change.  
You can change any widget's default style for a given state by selecting the state, then selecting the widget and changing its properties using the Properties palette.  You can also use the Global styling widgets to style widgets globally for any of the widget states.</p>

<p>For complext widgets, some of the subwidgets can be styled in the Hover and Selected states, as well as the Normal state. 
Note that for the other states, many of the subwidgets are grayed out when the state is selected, because styling has no effect on the subwidgets in those states. </p>
