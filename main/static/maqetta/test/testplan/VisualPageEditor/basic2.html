	<h2 class="test_section">Widgets, images, open/save (relative layout)</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Standard setup things: Clear the browser cache. Launch the daVinci server. 
				Login if necessary. 
				In some cases, you'll want to setup a virgin user environment by creating a whole new user login.</li>
		<li>Click on the "New file" icon on the main toolbar. Choose any filename.</li>
		<li>Drag a few primitive widgets onto the canvas (e.g., Button, TextBox, Calendar).</li>
		<li>Drag an image onto the canvas (e.g., SampleBanner.jpg).</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>
		<li>In the Files palette, double-click on the file you just created to re-open the file.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>The saved file should open and its contents should be the same as how it was when you clicked on the Save button.</li>
		<li>The canvas should show the widgets and image(s) that you dragged onto the canvas.</li>
		<li>The Outline palette should show the widgets and image(s).</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">HTML and OpenAjax widgets (continuation of previous)</h2>

		<li>Drag a few HTML widgets onto the canvas (e.g., DIV, SPAN, LABEL).</li>
		<li><span style="color:red; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">(OpenAjax widgets aren't working with 0.6, will be restored with 0.7.)</span> 
			Drag a few OpenAjax widgets onto the canvas (e.g., jQuery Button, YUI Calendar, YUI Color Picker).</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>

	<h2 class="test_section">Container widgets (continuation of previous)</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Re-open the file created in the previous steps.</li>
		<li>Drag a few container widgets onto the canvas (e.g., ContentPane, Accordion, TabContainer).</li>
		<li>Drag an HTML DIV widget onto the canvas.</li>
		<li>Drag a couple of primitive widgets into each container (e.g., Button, TextBox, HTML LABEL, HTML SPAN).</li>
		<li>Drag a couple of container widgets inside other containers to create nested containers (e.g., Accordion inside of a TabContainer). 
				Drag primitive widgets into the nested container widget.</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file. <span style="color:red">The asterisks that indicates that the file is "dirty" should go away.</span></li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>
		<li>In the Files palette, double-click on the file you just created to re-open the file.</li>

	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>The saved file should open and its contents should be the same as how it was when you clicked on the Save button.</li>
		<li>The canvas should show the widgets and image(s) that you dragged onto the canvas.</li>

	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Re-open the file created in the previous steps.</li>
		<li>Click to select various widgets.</li>
		<li>Move selected widgets to different locations. 
				With relative layout, you should be able to re-order widgets within the flow via drag/drop. 
				With absolute layout, you should be able to change widget position.</li>
		<li>Some widgets are resizable and show resize knobs when selected. For example, ContentPane and Calendar. Drag the knobs to resize some widgets.</li>
		<li>Delete a widget by selecting it and then invoking the "Delete" command from the context menu.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>You should be able to select, move, resize and delete widgets.</li>
