	<h2 class="test_section">Widget hierarchy</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>Standard setup things: Clear the browser cache. Launch the daVinci server. 
				Login if necessary. 
				In some cases, you'll want to setup a virgin user environment by creating a whole new user login.</li>
		<li>Select "Create New HTML File" from New menu. A folder titled showing the file name should appear in the Outline palette.</li>
		<li>Drag a Button and a TextBox onto the canvas.  A Button entry and a TextBox entry should appear in the Outline palette.</li>
		<li>Drag a ContentPane onto the canvas. A ContentPane entry should appear in the Outline palette.</li>
		<li>Drag a Button into the ContentPane. A tree control (with a +/- square) should appear next to the ContentPane entry in the Outline palette.</li>
		<li>Click on the + square next to the ContentPane to expand it. A child Button entry should be displayed.</li>
		<li>Click on the - square next to the ContentPane to collapse it.</li>
		<li>On the canvas, drag a DIV into the ContentPane. A &lt;div&gt; entry should appear in the Outline palette as a child of the ContentPane.</li>
		<li>On the canvas, drag a Label and a ComboBox into the DIV. A + square should appear next to the &lt;div&gt; entry in the Outline palette.</li>
		<li>On the Outline palette, expand the &lt;div&gt; entry. A &lt;label&gt; and a ComboBox entry should appear as children of the &lt;div&gt;.</li>
		<li>On the canvas, drag a TabContainer onto an empty space on the canvas. A TabContainer should appear in the Outline palette under the root "Application" folder.</li>
		<li>On the Outline palette, expand the TabContainer. It should contain two ContentPanes, one for each tab in the TabContainer.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>When no files are open, the Outline palette is empty.</li>
		<li>When you open a new file, the Outline palette displays a folder titled "Application".</li>
		<li>When you drag a widget (or an HTML element) onto the canvas, an entry is added to the Outline palette,
		    consisting of an eyeball icon, a widget icon, and the widget name (e.g. "Button").</li>
		<li>Widgets are displayed in a tree-like hierarchy on the Outline palette.
			<ul>
			<li>Widgets that are dropped directly onto the canvas are displayed in the Outline palette under the root "Application" folder.</li>
			<li>Widgets that are dropped into container widgets are displayed in the Outline palette under their parent container's folder.</li>
			</ul></li> 
		<li>The widget icon for all container widgets is a folder.
			<ul>
			<li>If the container contains other widgets, a tree control (+/- square) is displayed to the left of the folder.</li> 
		    <li>If the container is empty, the tree control is not displayed.</li>
		    <li>When you click on the + square, the folder expands to show the contents of the folder.</li>
		    <li>When you click on the - square, the folder collapses.</li>
		    </ul></li>
	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">Selecting widgets from the Outline palette</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>(continuing on the same file created in the previous test)</li>
		<li>Click on any widget entry in the Outline palette to select it, and verify that the corresponding widget is also selected on the canvas.</li>
		<li>In the Outline palette, expand the TabContainer and click on each child ContentPane of the TabContainer. Note how this selects each tab in the TabContainer on the canvas.</li>
		<li>In the Outline palette, expand the TabContainer and select the second ContentPane.</li> 
		<li>On the canvas, drag a Calendar widget onto the TabContainer. Verify that the Calendar goes onto Tab 2.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>When you select a widget entry in the Outline palette, the corresponding widget or subwidget is also selected on the canvas.</li>
		<li>When you select a widget or subwidget on the canvas, the corresponding widget entry in the Outline palette is also selected.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">Setting widget visibility</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>(continuing on the same file created in the previous test)</li>
		<li>In the Outline palette, click on the eyeball icon next to the TabContainer. The eyeball should close and the TabContainer should become invisible on the canvas.</li>
		<li>In the Outline palette, click on the eyeball icon next to the TextBox. The eyeball should close and the TextBox should become invisible on the canvas.</li>
		<li>Click on the "Save" icon on the main toolbar to save the new file.</li>
		<li>Click on the "X" close button for the editor tab for this file</li>
		<li>In the Files palette, double-click on the file you just created to re-open the file.</li>
		<li>In the Outline palette, the eyeball icons for the TextBox and the TabContainer should still be closed, and their widgets should still be invisible on the canvas.</li>
		<li>In the Outline palette, click on the closed eyeball icon next to the TabContainer. The eyeball should open and the TabContainer should become visible on the canvas.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>Every entry in the Outline palette should have an eyeball icon in the left-most column (except the root "Application folder").</li>
		<li>All widgets are initially displayed with their eyeball icon open.</li>
		<li>The eyeball icon can be toggled open or closed by clicking on the icon.
			<ul>
			<li>When you click on the open eyeball, the eyeball will close and the corresponding widget on the canvas will become invisible.</li>
			<li>When you click on the closed eyeball, the eyeball will open and the corresponding widget on the canvas will become visible.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>When a container widget's eyeball icon is toggled, the container and all of it's children will become invisible or visible on the canvas.
			<br />(Note - the children eyeball icons do not close unless you specifically click on a child widget's eyeball icon.)</li>
		<li>Eyeball icons retain their state.
			<ul>
			<li>When you click off of a widget entry, the eyeball eyecon should retain its state.</li>
			<li>When you close the file and re-open it, the eyeball should retain its saved state.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>See the StatesPalette test plan for testing widget visibility for different states.</li> 
	</ol>

	<h2 class="test_section">Widget rearrangement</h2>
	<h3 class="steps_subsection">Steps</h3>
	<ol class="steps">
		<li>(continuing on the same file created in the previous test)</li>
		<li>Try to rearrange the widgets by dragging and dropping rows in the Outline palette.
			Try to reorder widgets with the same parent and try to move a widget to a different parent.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="expectedResults_subsection">Expected results</h3>
	<ol class="expectedResults">
		<li>You should be able rearrange widgets arbitrarily in the Outline palette.</li> 
		<li><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">
			(In 0.6, you can't drag/drop arbitrarily. We are lacking protection against
			doing invalid reparenting. For example, TabContainer can only have
			layout containers such as ContentPane as children, but
			the Outline palette allows rearrangement such that a
			Button or SPAN can be a direct child of TabContainer.
			This will be addressed in a future release.</span></li>
